# GAME-Mars_Marine-UE4-Blueprint
 #Mars_Marine (The demonstration film is at very bottom and in README): Project developed with Unreal Engine 4 and Blueprint.  A game in which we play the role of a Marine fighting monsters on Mars. A game based on Alien Shooter. This is one of the two main projects (the other is a master's thesis) that I will be developing for my learning purposes.  In game are: - shooting mechanics - life renewal system - player rotation - makeshift HUD - opponents with simple AI - a few sounds.
