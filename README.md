Project developed with Unreal Engine 4 and Blueprint.

A game in which we play the role of a Marine fighting monsters on Mars. A game based on Alien Shooter. This is one of the two main projects (the other is a master's thesis) that I will be developing for my learning purposes.

The game has been added:
- shooting mechanics
- life renewal system
- player rotation
- makeshift HUD
- opponents with simple AI
- a few sounds
